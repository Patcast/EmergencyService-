# EmergencyService

This is a project that uses OOP principles to simulate an emergency center that manages multiple sensors in different sensors. It particularly focuses on making the code as flexible and expandable as possible.

libEmergency: Contains the library that we made to fulfill the requierments. 
testEmergency: Is an example on how to use the library


Note: This repository was migrated from another VC that is managed by my University.
